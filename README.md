# news-browser

## Overview

Small app made as an excercise, written using React, React Router and ES6.

As API does not allow cross-origin requests in order to see development preview you need to allow CORS in the browser ([Allow-Control-Allow-Origin Chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi))

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
